# AngleSensor-Arduino-Servo
A servo system illustration using an AAT angle sensor, an Arduino, a stepper motor, and a modified clock.

Specifically, we used an NVE AAT003 angle sensor, an Arduino Uno, a SparkFun ROB-12779 stepper driver, and 
an AD004 magnetic proximity sensor to initialize the clock hand to the 12:00 position.
